# Easy Practice Projects
This repository is meant to hold various simple projects written in Scala to help me learn the language. Project ideas came from ChatGPT. 

The projects are showcased in the Examples.scala file, which has its methods called in Main.scala (both of which are in src/main/scala). Examples can be viewed using `sbt run`
